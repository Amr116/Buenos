# Buenos
BUENOS is a skeleton operating system running on a virtual machine called YAMS. BUENOS is a realistic system, running on an almost real machine. The BUENOS system supports multiple CPUs, provides threading and a wide variety of synchronization primitives. It also includes a skeleton code for userland program support, partial support for a virtual memory subsystem, a trivial filesystem and some networking functionality. The main idea of the system is to give a real working multiprocessor operating system kernel which is as small and simple as possible. BUENOS could be quite easily ported to a real MIPS32 hardware.
